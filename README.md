# Clustering Wheat Kernels Using Machine Learning


Clustering is a form of machine learning techniques that allow you to find natural groupings and patterns in unlabeled data (also known as an unsupervised learning technique). Unlike many machine learning techniques, cluster analysis is not used for predicting the future outcome; however, it is a technique used for finding classes in large groups data. 


When looking in the context of business, many use cases often involve the segmentation of a large number of customers in similar groups. Today, we will look at an unsupervised dataset containing 7 characteristics that help describe hundreds of wheat kernels. These will be clustered into groups using the KMeans Clustering algorithm.

* Title - Clustering Analysis of Wheat Kernels
* Goal - To find defined clusters for our wheat kernels, using 7 characteristics 
* Technique - KMeans Clustering
* Technologies â€“ Python (Jupyter Notebook)
